International Day of Peace (also known as "Peace Day") is an annual event declared by the UN General Assembly to represent 24 hours of celebrating unity and ceasefire as an international community. Peace Day was first celebrated in 1981, and is still observed by most nations and countries to this day.
  
In June of 1954 the UN Assotiation gifted the Japanese Peace Bell to the governmnet of Japan. It was cast from coins that were donated children from all over the world. The bell is located in the Japanese Garden of the United Nations headquarters. To commemerate the start of Peace Day, the bell is rung by the Secretary General, UN executives, and other public figures every year on Septenber 21.
  
Each year, the UN decides on a theme that is prevalent in society that year, and creates event and workshops. This year the theme is "End Racism. Build Peace".
