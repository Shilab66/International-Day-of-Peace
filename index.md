International Day of Peace (also known as "Peace Day") is an annual event declared by the UN General Assembly to represent 24 hours of celebrating unity and the welfar of humanity as an international community. Peace Day was first celebrated in 1981, and two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate Peace Day as a period of non-violence and cease-fire
  
In June of 1954 the UN Assotiation gifted the Japanese Peace Bell to the governmnet of Japan. It was cast from coins that were donated children from all over the world. The bell is located in the Japanese Garden of the United Nations headquarters. To commemerate the start of Peace Day, the bell is rung by the Secretary General, UN executives, and other public figures every year on Septenber 21.
  
Each year, the UN decides on a theme that is relavent to international community, and creates event and workshops. This year the theme is "End Racism. Build Peace". The UN website says

>Achieving true peace entails much more than laying down arms.  It requires the building of societies where all members feel that they can flourish. It involves creating a world in which people are treated equally, regardless of their race. Racism continues to poison institutions, social structures, and everyday life in every society. It destabilizes societies, undermines democracies, erodes the legitimacy of governments, and the linkages between racism and gender inequality are unmistakable.

As war and political unrest continue to emerge in different parts of the world, causing people to flee, we have seen racial discrimination at borders. During the aftermath of the Covi-19 pandemic and the lockdown, we have seen how certain racial groups have been hit harder than others. As economies suffer and inflation cause prises to rise, we have seen hate speech and violence directed at certain minority groups.

However, we as a global community can play our part in fighting agaist racial descrimination. We can work to dismantle the structures that allow rasicm to hrive in our society. We can support movements for equality and human rights. We can speak out against hate speech and promote anti-racism through education and reparatory justice.
